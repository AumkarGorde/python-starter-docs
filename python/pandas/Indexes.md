# Indexes
- An index in pandas is a label (or set of labels) that uniquely identifies rows and sometimes columns in a DataFrame or Series
	- Faster Lookups
- Every dataFrame has a default index
- Set Index
	- `df.set_index('email')`
		- Returns a new df with 'email' as the index
		- Does not change the original df
	- `df.set_index('email', inplace=True)`
		- Modifies the original df directly
		- No new df is returned, the method returns `None`
- Index helps to use `df.loc` with particular index
	- `df.loc['abc@em.com']` - gives all detail about user abc
		- Once index is assigned you cannot use default index 
			- `df.loc[0]` - error you can use `iloc` if you want to use default index
